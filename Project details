RFID Reader Project using LPC2138 ARM Microcontroller
Project Description
The RFID Reader Project using LPC2138 ARM Microcontroller is an advanced solution that not only reads RFID tags but also allows users to add new employee data and delete previous employee data using an external keypad and UART1 communication. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive employee management system with seamless integration capabilities.
Key Features
•	LPC2138 ARM Controller: Utilizing the LPC2138 microcontroller for robust and reliable performance.
•	RFID Module Integration: Seamless integration with RFID modules for reading and processing RFID tags.
•	UART Communication: RFID data is communicated with the LPC2138 ARM Controller through UART for efficient data transfer. UART1 is dedicated to external devices such as keypads.
•	Keypad Integration: The project supports external keypads for user input, enabling the addition and deletion of employee data.
•	Configurable Parameters: Users can configure parameters such as baud rate, read power, and tag filtering to suit specific application requirements.
•	Employee Data Management: Allows the addition of new employee data through UART1 and the keypad. Existing employee data can also be deleted using the keypad.
•	Simple Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the RFID reader and managing employee data.
